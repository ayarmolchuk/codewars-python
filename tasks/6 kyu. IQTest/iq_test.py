# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one
# of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs
# from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among
# the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the
# elements start from 1 (not 0)
